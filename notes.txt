//define n-dimensional spherical coordinates

For n-dimensional spherical coordinates, we have r, the radial coordinate, $n-2$ angles $\phi_1 \dots \phi_{n-2}$,  which range between [0,$\pi$] and $\phi_{n-1}$ which is between [0, $2\pi$] and is called the azimuthal angle. 

With this we can set up the transformation between cartesian coordinates ($x_1 \dots x_n$) to
\begin{align}
    \begin{array}{c}
        x_1 = r\cos(\phi_1) \\
        x_2 = r\sin(\phi_1)\cos(\phi_2) \\
        x_3 = r\sin(\phi_1)\sin(\phi_2)cos(\phi_3) \\
        \cdot\\
        \cdot\\
        \cdot\\
        x_{n-1} = r\sin(\phi_1)\sin(\phi_2)\dots\sin(\phi_{n-2})\cos(\phi_{n-1}) \\
        x_{n} = r\sin(\phi_1)\sin(\phi_2)\dots\sin(\phi_{n-2})\sin(\phi_{n-1}) 
    \end{array}
\end{align}

We can express the arbitrary coordinate $x_i$ as 

\begin{align}
    x_i = r\prod_{j=1}^{i-1}sin(\phi_j)cos(\phi_i)
\end{align}

where  $1 \le i \leq n-1$. 

For $x_n$, we have a different formula. This is because $\phi_{n-1}$ behaves differently from the other angles ?? ??? ?? ? ? ?.

\begin{align}
    x_n = r\prod_{j=1}^{n-2}sin(\phi_j)sin(\phi_{n-1})
\end{align}

Once we have this, we can try to compute the Jacobian of our n dimensional spherical coordinates.

\begin{align}
    J_n =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        c_1 & -r s_1 c_2 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
        s_1 c_2 & r c_1 c_2 & -r s_2 c_3 & \cdots & 0 \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        s_1 \cdots s_{n-2} c_{n-1} & r c_1 \cdots c_{n-2} & \cdots & \cdots & -r s_{n-2} s_{n-1} \\
        s_1 \cdots s_{n-2} c_{n-1} & r s_1 \cdots s_{n-2} & \cdots & \cdots & r s_{n-2} \cdots s_{n-1} c_{n-1}
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}

    I DID THIS ALREADY IN THE LATEX

//we can integrate this to get the total hyper volume

    DIDNT REALLY EVER EXPLAIN THIS

//follow steps simply up to where beta functions appear


//define gamma function
    to complete the next step, we must understand how the gamma and beta function work. The gamma function is defined as Γ(n) = (n-1)!. The purpose of the gamma function is to extend the factorial function to non-integer numbers.This is necessary when applying the formula for the volume of an n-ball when "n" is an odd number.
    
//define beta function in terms of gamma function
    the beta function is then defined as B(x,y)= ∫(0->1) t^(x-1) (1-t)^(y-1) dt. This can also be defined in terms of the gamma function as Γ(x)Γ(y)/Γ(x+y). We can see this relationship by proving that Γ(x)Γ(y) = B(x,y)Γ(x+y).
    First write Γ(x)Γ(y) as integrals Γ(x)Γ(y) = ∫(0->∞)u^(x-1)e^(-u) du * ∫(0->∞)v^(y-1)e^(-v) dv
    We can re-write this as ∫(0->∞) u^(x-1) v^(y-1) (e^(-u-v) dudv
    Now change variables using G(s,t) where u=st and v=s(1-t) and where the |Jac(G)| = s
    We can the bounds for this would be 0<=s<=∞, 0<=t<=1
    Write new integral as ∫(0->1)∫(0->∞) (st)^(x-1) s^(y-1) (1-t)^(y-1) e^(-st-s+st) s dsdt
    This can be split up into ∫(0->1)(1-t)^(y-1) dt * ∫(0->∞) s^(x-1) s(y-1) e^(-s) ds
    Which we can see is B(x,y)Γ(x+y)
    This proves how the Beta function is related to the gamma function
    
    
    
//explain how we can sub in beta functions
    ALTERNATE EXPLANATION USING SIN DEF OF BETA FUNCTION (GIVEN BY CLAUDE) 
                Let me explain how we recognize that Beta functions appear in these integrals. The key is recognizing a pattern in integrals of powers of sine.
            
            The integrals we're dealing with are of the form:
            ∫₀ᵗ/² sinᵏ(φ) dφ  (where k varies from n-2 down to 1)
            
            The Beta function B(x,y) has a special representation in terms of sine:
            B(x,y) = 2∫₀ᵗ/² sin²ˣ⁻¹(φ) cos²ʸ⁻¹(φ) dφ
            
            Now, here's the crucial insight. When y = 1/2, cos²ʸ⁻¹(φ) = 1, so:
            B(x,1/2) = 2∫₀ᵗ/² sin²ˣ⁻¹(φ) dφ
            
            Looking at our original integrals:
            ∫₀ᵗ/² sinⁿ⁻²(φ₁) dφ₁
            ∫₀ᵗ/² sinⁿ⁻³(φ₂) dφ₂
            etc.
            
            We can match these to the Beta function form:
            - For sinⁿ⁻²(φ₁): x = (n-1)/2 gives us B((n-1)/2, 1/2)
            - For sinⁿ⁻³(φ₂): x = (n-2)/2 gives us B((n-2)/2, 1/2)
            And so on...
            
            This recognition lets us convert all our difficult sine integrals into Beta functions, which can then be expressed in terms of Gamma functions - a more manageable form.


    Beta Function B(x,y) and Angular Integral Ik
        B(x,y) = ∫(0->1) t^(x-1) (1-t)^(y-1) dt
        Ik = ∫(0->π) (sinφ)^k dφ, k ≃ n
    Symmetrical properties of Sine.
        Ik = 2 ∫(0->π/2) (sinφ)^k dφ
    substitute t = sin^2(φ)
        sin^2(φ) = t --> t^1/2 = sinφ
        1 - cos^2(φ) = t --> cos^2(φ) = 1 - t --? cosφ = (1 - t)^1/2
        dt = 2 sinφ cosφ dφ -> dφ = dt / (2 sinφ cosφ) -> dφ = dt / (2 t^1/2 (1-t)^1/2)
    Find bounds of t.
        When φ = π/2, sin^2(π/2) = t = 1.
        When φ = 0, sin^2(0) = t = 0.
    Using information above. Convert Angular Integral Ik from terms of φ to terms of t.
        Ik = 2 ∫(0->π/2) (sinφ)^k dφ -> Ik = 2 ∫(0->1) (t^1/2)^k / (2 t^(1/2) (1-t)^(1/2)) dt
    Simplify Angular Integral Ik.
        Ik = ∫(0->1) (t)^(k/2) t^(-1/2) (1-t)^(-1/2) dt -> Ik = ∫(0->1) (t)^(k/2 - 1/2) (1-t)^(-1/2) dt
    Recognize that the Angular Integral Ik looks similar to the Beta Function B(x,y). We can find the values of x and y.
        x = (k+1) / 2
        y = 1 / 2
    We can substitute the remaining integrals in Vn(R) with B((k+1)/2, 1/2). We can assume k = n - 2 for the first integral, then k = n - 3 for the second integral.
        Vn(R) = (R^(n)/n) (2∫(0->π/2)(sinφ1)^n-2 dφ1) (2∫(0->π/2)(sin2)^n-3 dφ2) ... (∫(0->2π) dφn-1) -> Vn(R) = (R^(n)/n) B((n - 1)/2, 1 / 2) B((n - 2) / 2, 1/2) ... 2B(1 / 2, 1 / 2)
        
    B(x,y) = ∫(0->1) t^(x-1) (1-t)^(y-1) dt --> B(x,y) = ∫(0->π) (sin^2(φ))^(x-1) (cos^2(φ))^(y-1) 2 sinφ cosφ dφ --> B(x,y)
    end up with Vn(R)=(R^(n)/n) B((n−1)/2,1/2)B((n−2)/2,1/2)B((n−3)/2,1/2)⋯B(1,1/2)⋅2B(1/2,1/2).

//sub these out for gamma function equivalents
    lets rewrite these beta functions as Vn(R)=(R^(n)/n) B((n/2)-(1/2) ,1/2)  B((n/2)-(2/2) ,1/2)  B((n/2)-(3/2) ,1/2)⋯B(1,1/2)⋅2B(1/2,1/2
    becuase earlier we proved that the Beta function B(x,y) = Γ(x)Γ(y)/Γ(x+y), we can see that this is able to be rewritten in terms of gamma functions
    


//using gamma function properties, rewrite generally
    this is done in the tex file
    
    blah blah blah, show first steps here 
    finally, (refer to photo on nathan's phone for how to go between last two steps on wiki)

//explain how this accounts for different odd and even "n"

    The formula derived for the volume of a sphere in nth-dimension can be categorized by whether "n" is odd or even. The gamma function term (Γ((n/2)+1)) behaves differently depending if it is a gamma function of a integer or half-integer. 
    For half-integer gamma function, Γ(n/2) = sqrt(π)*((n-2)!!/2^((n-1)/2)).
     n!! denotes a double factorial
    For integer gamma functions, Γ(n) = (n/2)!
    Even n dimensions result in positive integer arguments for the gamma function
    Odd n dimensions result in positive half-integer arguments for the gamma function.
    Note that these are all non-negative arguments for the gamma function as n cannot be zero or negative.
    
    Formula for the volume of "n" spheres = (((π^(n/2))*(R^n))/(Γ((n/2)+1)))
    
    Formula for the volume of even "n" spheres = (π^(n/2)*(R^2))/((n/2)!)
        Since Γ((n/2)+1), for all even integers of n the gamma function will give out values for integers. Γ(n/2)+1) can be rewritten as (n/2)!. 
        
    Formula for the volume of odd "n" spheres = ((π^(n/2)*(R^2))/(((sqrtπ)(n!!))/(2^((n+!)/2))))
        The same idea applies for the formula to find the volume of even "n" spheres except that the gamma function will give out values for half-integers. Since half-integers give out different values for the gamma function than normal integers, the gamma function has to be written out differently for off "n" spheres.
